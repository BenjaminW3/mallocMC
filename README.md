About This Repository
---------------------

This repository is a
[fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28software_development%29)
of the **ScatterAlloc** project from the
*Managed Volume Processing* group at TU Graz (kudos!).

Our aim is to improve the implementation, add new features and to fix some
minor bugs.


Branches
--------

**master:** our stable new releases

**dev:**    our development branch - start and merge new branches here

**tugraz:** kind-of the "upstream" branch - only used to receive new releases
            from the TU Graz group
